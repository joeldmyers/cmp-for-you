<div style="overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:20px;">
<div style="font-weight:normal; padding:0 0 8px 0; font-size:18px;">Why can't I use
Internet Explorer or Safari?</div>
<div>Unfortunately Internet Explorer
(IE) and Safari do not support the technology we use to provide a CMPForYou.com
video connection. It is possible to install a plugin
for IE to get CMpForYou.com to work, but if you are going to download and
install something, we recommend you download&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html"><span
style='color:#0000F6'>Google Chrome&nbsp;</span></a>or&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?scene=2#download-fx"><span
style='color:#0000F6'>Mozilla Firefox</span></a>&nbsp;instead.</div>

<div style="overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:20px;">
<div style="font-weight:normal; padding:0 0 8px 0; font-size:18px;">Is Video
Consultation HIPAA compliant?</div>
<div>Yes it is.Being HIPAA compliant means
addressing every patient's privacy and keeping all identifiable health
information guarded and secure. It means understanding how to operate according
to the Privacy and Security Rules.</div>
</div>


<div style="overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:20px;">
<div style="font-weight:normal; padding:0 0 8px 0; font-size:18px;">My
audio and/or video is shaky</div>

<ol>
<li style="line-height:22px;font-size:16px;">Sometimes the audio and video&nbsp;will
be shaky for the first minute or two&nbsp;as the connection is being
established. This is normal. Usually after a minute or two the video connection
will clear up.
</li>

<li style="line-height:22px;font-size:16px;">Also make sure you or your participant don?t have concurrent internet connections taking up large amounts of bandwidth (like downloading large files, music, movies, several web pages open at the same time, etc).</li>
<li style="line-height:22px;font-size:16px;"> If you are on a slow internet connection, the video quality is limited by how fast your internet service is able to upload and download the video feed.</li>
<li style="line-height:22px;font-size:16px;">If you have an older computer or if you have several programs open and running, sometimes the video card will have a hard time keeping up with the video rendering. It may help if you close unused desktop applications to free up computer power for the video call.</li>
</ol>


<div style="overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:20px;">
<div style="font-weight:normal; padding:0 0 8px 0; font-size:18px;">I can see but
can't hear my patient or doctor?</div>
</div>

<div style="overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:20px;">
<div style="font-weight:normal; padding:0 0 8px 0; font-size:18px;">If you can see
your participant, but can't hear him/her, check the following:</div>
</div>

<ol >
<li style="line-height:22px;font-size:14px;"> Do you have speakers? Are they are turned on and unmuted? Can you play sounds from other websites (e.g. Pandora)?
</li>
<li style="line-height:22px;font-size:14px;"> D Does your participant have a microphone? Is it turned on and unmuted?
</li>
<li style="line-height:22px;font-size:14px;">Make sure the microphone that the participant gave permission to use in the browser is the one he/she is using.
</li>
<li style="line-height:22px;font-size:14px;"> Did the participant enable the 'Mute Mic' control, if so have him/her click 'Unmute Mic'.
</li>
<li style="line-height:22px;font-size:14px;"> Are you using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox? Are they up to date?
</li>
<li style="line-height:22px;font-size:14px;">   Refresh your browsers.
</li>
<li style="line-height:22px;font-size:14px;">  Both you and your participant try using Google Chrome only.
</li>
<li style="line-height:22px;font-size:14px;"> Restart your computers.
</li>

<div style="overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:20px;">
<div style="font-weight:normal; padding:0 0 8px 0; font-size:16px;">How
to have the best possible experience using Our Video?</div>

</div>

<div style="overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:20px;">

<div>We recommend doing the following to have the best experience using Doxy.me:</div>
</div>

<ul>
<li style="font-size:15px;">    Use an HD webcam camera to acheive an HD video feed.</li>
<li style="font-size:15px;">  If you or your participant experience audio feedback, use headphones/headset or microphone/speakers with echo cancellation.</li>
<li style="font-size:15px;"> Face a light source and limit background noise.</li>
<li style="font-size:15px;"> Sit between 2 ft to 4 ft from the webcam.</li>
<li style="font-size:15px;"> Sit between 2 ft to 4 ft from the webcam.</li>
<li style="font-size:15px;"> Use 1024x768 resolution or greater.</li>
<li style="font-size:15px;">   The computer helps render the video on the browser, so newer computers and those with plenty of available processing power tend to have better performance.</li>
<li style="font-size:15px;">The video quality adjusts based on available bandwidth, the faster and more stable your broadband connection, the better the video quality they will receive.</li>
<li style="font-size:15px;">Limit internet usage during a call. For example, do not stream movies or download music at the same time, even on a different computer on the same network.</li>
<li style="font-size:15px;"> Use an ethernet cable to connect to the internet (sometimes a poor Wifi connection can impact call quality).</li>
<li style="font-size:15px;">Make sure UDP port 3478 is open, ideally all UDP ports between 1025 - 65535 should be open.</li>
</ul>

<div>Common problems and solutions for clinics and Doctors or Nurses wanting to use.</div>
</div>
<div style="overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:20px;">

<div>Often users at
a large clinic or hospital face difficulties using video because of security
provisions health IT staff put into place.</div>
</div>
<div style="overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:20px;">

<div>Only Internet Explorer is installed on the computer- Many EHRs
are built specifically for Internet Explorer. As a result, IT staff will only
install Internet Explorer and often not allow other applications such as
browsers to be installed</div>
</div>

<div style="overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:20px;">

<div>Firewall
is blocking access to Doxy.me or preventing it from
working correctly-
For security reasons, IT staff will often block access to websites and network
ports that are not typically used in health care.</div>
</div>


<div style="overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:20px;">
<div style="font-weight:normal; padding:0 0 8px 0; font-size:20px;">SOLUTION:</div>
<div>Based on our experience working with clinics and doctors, we recommend using a laptop or Chromebook for Video. There are several advantages to this approach. For example, you can have a dedicated laptop that is shared among
providers and can move the laptop between rooms wherever needed. Also, you can
position the &nbsp;laptop next to the clinic computers
with the EHR; this allows the provider to meet with the patient via video using
the laptop and chart in the EHR on the clinic computers.</div>
