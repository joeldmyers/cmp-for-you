<h5 class="small-heading">We are at the start of building an exciting company that will:</h5>
<ul style="margin-left:-20px;">
<li>Make a difference by engaging exceptional physicians and the latest technology from around the world . We are here introducing the best medical experts to consumers and patients. Later the same experts may treat the patients. <br>We are not involved with that part.</li>
<li>Medical Experts on our web site and specialists utilizing  www.CMPForYou.com are not employees or independent contractor service providers of our company. Any opinions, advice, or information expressed by any such professionals are those of the professional and the professional alone and they do not reflect the opinions of Our Company</li>
</ul>

It’s a known fact that patients feel more comfortable and convenient when treated at home by home health service providers, 
then nursing homes, outpatient clinics and finally if necessary in a hospital. 
In addition most patients would rather have an online consultation by messaging or video to obtain information, guidance  and second opinion rather than travel to a doctor’s office. 
Our platform incorporates HIPAA  - compliant telecommunication System.
<br><br> 
Another important element of our approach is to provide a platform for doctors, nurses and other health providers to serve the patients in their spare time after they finish their full time duties whether it is during the week, or weekends or during the holidays. <br><br> 


Once we introduce the patient to the health care provider, we leave the treatment process to them including collection from Medicare and Insurance Companies.
<br>
You can locate more doctors   on our site in a few minutes   than 100 hospitals combined. Our goal is to offer the most advanced and research based technologies, while being mindful of the financial constraints of your long or short-term needs.  Our team of experts is constantly available to find solutions to your problems.
<br><br> You can get basic online consultation for a small fee at less than the cost of a meal. Advanced video online consultations where you receive face-to-face consultation are also available; it’s like magic. You save an average of three hours this way compared to a visit to the doctor’s office.
<br><strong>On April 28, 2014, the FSMB (Federation of State Medical Boards)</strong> approved telemedicine <i>consultations between physician and patient being equivalent to in-person consultations as long as the interaction was done via videoconference. </i>

<strong>We are  Not a Medical Provider and Do Not Provide Medical Treatment on our website.</strong><br>
You should seek   medical diagnosis, or treatment, or other professional healthcare help from your own medical doctor or the applicable health care provider.  In case of a medical emergency, call 911 ASAP. Any online consultation with medical experts by online messaging and/or live video consultation is meant for providing information and second opinion on day to day health problems or chronic diseases.

<h5 class="small-heading">Joining this site is FREE.</h5>

This will save you a trip to the hospital or a sleepless night worrying about something, which may not even exist.<br>

Why not spare your extra time to offer humanitarian services to mankind and in the process get extra pay.  You will get more new patients while keeping your existing ones. Prepare for renewed prosperity while the industry twists and turns, and set yourself up to profit from this.
At the same time make somebody happy and healthy.
