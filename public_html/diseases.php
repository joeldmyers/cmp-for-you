<h5 class="small-heading">A medical or psychiatric emergency</h5>An emergency medical condition is a psychiatric or medical or  condition that shows  itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that you could reasonably<br> expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in any of the following :

<ul class="text-left">
<li>serious harm to you or your family member's health</li>
<li>serious disabling in your or your family member's bodily functions</li>
<li>serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part</li></ul>

<strong>If you think you or your family member has a medical or psychiatric emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest hospital. Do not attempt to access emergency care through this website.</strong><br><br>
In California, a psychiatric condition is an emergency medical condition if it has acute symptoms that make a person an immediate danger to himself or others or not immediately able to provide for, or use, food, shelter, or clothing, due to the mental disorder. Examples of symptoms that may be an emergency medical condition include the following:

<ul class="text-left">
<li>sudden inability to talk or to move one side of the body, or sudden slurred speech</li>
<li>sudden onset of severe abdominal pain</li>
<li>chest pain or pressure which may radiate to the arms, neck, back, shoulder, jaw, arm, or wrist</li>
<li>severe shortness of breath</li>
<li>sudden decrease in or loss of consciousness</li>
<li>severe, persistent bleeding that cannot be stopped</li>
<li>major injuries such as gunshot or stab wounds or severe injuries from a vehicle accident</li>
<li>for pregnant women only: "active labor," which means a labor when there is inadequate time for a safe transfer to a Plan hospital (or designated hospital) before delivery or if a transfer poses a threat to the health of the woman or unborn child</li>
</ul>
<i>If you think you or your family member has a medical emergency, call 911 immediately !</i>

<h5 class="small-heading margin-top-30">Heart disease</h5>Most of the people think that heart disease is probably not their problem, it often happens to others, but in reality a large number of deaths occur due to the heart disease in US. In case if it gets severe then the patient will either end up by losing his/her life or have   disability. Heart disease has many different forms among which the most common reason of heart disease is either the blockage of coronary arteries or sometimes these arteries becomes narrow, which eventually affect the blood vessels that circulates the blood to the heart. This particular disease is called coronary artery disease. It happens gradually over different time intervals and it  is possibly the biggest reason that causes heart attacks.<br/><br/>Symptoms can include:<ul class="text-left"><li>Chest pain (angina)</li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed</li><li> Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back</li></ul><br/>You might not be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease until you have a heart attack, angina, stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch for cardiovascular symptoms and discuss concerns with your doctor. Cardiovascular disease can sometimes be found early with regular exams.

  <div>
The "heart disease" and "cardiovascular disease" are the two terms that we used to denote the same problem. Narrowed arteries, blocked vessels, angina or stroke come under the cardiovascular disease. 
 There are multiple conditions that place an impact on our heart in different ways. Blood vessel diseases, coronary disease, heart flow problems, also known as (arrhythmia) and congenital heart defects (A heart defect you are born with).  There are  a few more problems that either occur to the valves in the heart or sometimes the heart does not pump well, which causes heart failure. There are certain measures that you can follow to successfully eliminate the heart disease risk.
</div>


<div class="margin-top-30 margin-bottom-30">
Following are the ways through which you can prevent yourself from the heart disease problems :<br>

<ul class="col-md-6 text-right disease">
<li>Always keep an eye on your blood pressure</li>
<li>Keep your cholesterol lower</li>
</ul>
<ul class="col-md-6 text-left">

<div class="cancer margin-top-30 margin-bottom-30">
<h5 class="small-heading">Cancer</h5>
Cancer is considered a major life taking disease. It develops uncommon cells that spread uncontrollably in the body. These cells are capable of  penetrating and demolishing body tissue. Cancer has the ability to cover the entire body in no time. In United States cancer is known as the second leading cause of death. But now it is being observed that improvements in cancer treatment and proper screening are leading patients to successfully overcoming this disease.<br>
Cancer initially flows in our cells, directly hitting the most important part of the body creating quick trouble. Usually our body makes new cells, according to our need as a substitute of the dead cells. This function of replacing old cells with the new ones often goes wrong. Sometimes new cells grow even when our body does not really need them and the old cells do not really die when they are supposed to be dead. This process of creating surplus cells causes a tumor.  <br>Tumor sometimes could be dangerous or sometimes not, the benign (not dangerous for human body) tumor cannot be considered  as cancer, whereas malignant (dangerous for human body) is a part of it. Malignant tumor creates cells, which can destroy the tissues and they have the tendency to spread into the other parts of the body. The tendency of shifting into the other parts of the body is called metastasis. Cancer is not a name of a single disease, but it consist of more than 100 different types and these types are named after the body part they belong  to . For an instance, if cancer is in lungs, then it would be named lung cancer; the same thing applies to breast cancer and so on. The causes and treatment varies according to the stage of cancer. Treatment methods are followed according to the level of cancer. Sometimes surgery is recommended or sometimes it become feasible to destroy the tumor with radiation or chemotherapy.

<div class="stroke margin-top-30 margin-bottom-30">
<h5 class="small-heading">Stroke</h5>
Stroke is yet another major illness. When the circulation of blood stops reaching  the brain then it causes stroke. It often happens that within no time brain cells start to die. Ischemic, hemorrhagic and transient ischemic are the three kinds of strokes. Ischemic stroke happens with a blood clot that stops the blood flowing  inside the brain. Hemorrhagic stroke  is caused by the breakage of blood vessels which leads  to the flow of blood  into the brain.  Transient ischemic attack occurs when the blood supply gets interrupted. This attack is also known as mini stroke.
<img src="<?=$remotelocation;?>includes/images/5.png" class="img-responsive">

<ul class="text-left disease">
There are few symptoms of stroke :
<li>Any side of the body suddenly starts getting weak. (It could be leg, arm or face)</li>
<li>Sudden trouble speaking or understanding speech.</li>
<li>Blurry vision</li>
<li>Difficulty in walking and balancing</li>
<li>Severe headache with no particular reason.</li>
</ul>

<div>If you encounter any of these symptoms happening to you then rushing to the hospital on an early basis would be the best option.  <br>
There are certain stroke therapies that quickly dissolve the blood clot and   put an end to the bleeding. Post stroke care helps the stroke victims in overcoming their disabilities. Drug therapy is yet another way through which the blood gets thinner and itâ€™s the most common cure for stroke. The major causes of stroke are, either blood supply is interrupted or lack of oxygen and nutrients to the brain. The positive thing about the disease is, it has a good  cure rate.  It has  been more than a decade now that only a few Americans have died of this disease.

<div class="diabetes margin-top-30 margin-bottom-30">
<h5 class="small-heading">Diabetes</h5>
Diabetes is a long-term illness regarding high blood sugar level in the body, which we also term as excessive  Glucose. Glucose is the important source of energy for the body cells; it works as a fuel to the cells so that these cells build muscles and tissues.  It is  also known as the driving force to the brain. Having diabetes means you have an excess  of Glucose in your blood. Regardless of what type of diabetes you have, excessive  amount of glucose is dangerous for health.
<img src="<?=$remotelocation;?>includes/images/7.png" class="img-responsive margin-bottom-30 margin-top-30">
Having high sugar level or glucose means you have diabetes; we get the glucose in our body from the food we eat. The hormone which gives energy to the cells is called Insulin.  <br>
There are two types of diabetes.   Type 1diabetes means your body does not produce   Insulin. <br> Type 1 diabetes  is a chronic disease. People with Type 2 diabetes  make insulin but their cells   lack proper usage of the insulin.  It  is the most common type of diabetes. Our body needs enough insulin to make the energy reach  the cells. If this does not really happen, the excess amount of the glucose will remain unused. The 3rd type is pre-diabetes, which means the sugar level in our body stays higher than a normal level. Ignoring pre-diabetes would eventually result in having   type 2  diabetes. 
<br> An excess amount of glucose can cause serious health issues; it can place a negative impact either on your eyes, kidneys or nerves. If a person has diabetes, then the probability of getting linked to stroke and heart diseases become higher, sometimes it even makes you lose your limb. Sometimes pregnant women also become diabetic and that is called gestational diabetes. It gets resolved after the delivery. There are  ways  you can  control your diabetes, such as doing exercise, weight control and following  a proper diet plan. Monitoring the glucose level and taking prescribed medicines would be beneficial as well.

<h5 class="small-heading margin-top-20">PreDiabetes</h5>
Pre-diabetes does not really mean that you have diabetes, one can simply not term pre-diabetes as type 2 diabetes unless and until the sugar level exceeds the normal level by  a significant amount. If the amount of sugar level in your body stays higher than the normal level but still does not exceed the extraordinary level then it cannot be considered as type 2 diabetes. Pre-diabetes almost takes a decade to become type 2 diabetes  if no intervention occurs in between.<br> 
Pre-diabetes places negative affect on the heart and circulatory system. Once you become a pre-diabetic then it means, the damage to your heart and circulatory system has already started. Diagnosing pre-diabetes could be a challenge as it does not have any particular symptoms, but scheduling a visit to your doctor for blood test would be helpful because the blood test will help you in an idea about the glucose level that you have in your blood.<br><br>Doctors recommend pre-diabetes test to those who are carrying overweight and have crossed the age of 45. One good thing about pre-diabetes is that it could be a plus point for you to concentrate on your health and improving it. Controlling pre-diabetes is possible and this is how you can restrict it from reaching the type 2 stage. As it has already been discussed, maintaining weight, making a proper diet plan, engaging your body in physical activity in your daily routine  will result in getting your sugar level back to normal state. The other way of controlling pre-diabetes is losing weight  by reducing calories. Losing 10-20 pounds can surely make a big difference. One more thing that you can do is keeping yourself physically active will result in making the insulin work better. Furthermore, doctors also suggest taking medicines to control glucose level.

<div class="copd margin-top-30 margin-bottom-30">
<h5 class="small-heading">COPD</h5>
COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This disease creates difficulty in breathing through the blockage in the lungs, which results in breathing problems. There are two types of COPD  : bronchitis and emphysema. Chronic bronchitis is the swelling on the lining of bronchial tube. Bronchial tube helps in breathing, inhaling and exhaling the air from the lungs. On the other hand emphysema happens when the air gets blocked at the pass through passages in the lungs and the tube gradually starts getting destroyed. COPD has no cure, but you can  reverse symptoms back to normal. Inhaling Dust, Cigarette smoke, pollution and chemical vapor can cause COPD. Initially COPD has no symptoms to be diagnosed; the symptoms can be diagnosed when they get worse. 
They include :

<ul class="text-right col-md-6 disease margin-top-10">
<li>Cough with mucus</li>
<li>Difficulty in breathing while doing physical activity</li>
</ul>
<ul class="text-left col-md-6 disease margin-top-10">
<li>Whistle sound during breathing</li>
<li>Tightness of Chest</li></ul><div class="clearfix"></div><br>

There are certain tests which help in diagnosing COPD. These tests are also prescribed by the doctors. Some of them are: lung function test, imaging tests and blood tests. Unfortunately, there is no cure for this disease; the only remedy for this disease is to get relief from the symptoms. Before stepping forward for treatment the best thing you can do is quit smoking as it would be your first step towards treating COPD. Further, there are very few options available for treating this disease positively, like taking prescribed medicines, oxygen therapy or lung transplant.

<div class="chronic-kidney margin-top-30 margin-bottom-30">
<h5 class="small-heading">Chronic Kidney Disease</h5>
Before describing   this disease in detail we first need to know the important role that our kidneys play in our body. Our kidneys are bean shaped with a size of no more  than our fists. They are placed in the lower middle back. Each kidney has a function of removing waste and extra water; these functions are being performed by the small nephrons present in the kidney to filter the circulating blood. The fluid later excretes from urine. The bladder stores the urine till it excretes.<br/>Kidney failure is  another major disease which is also known as chronic kidney disease. Kidneys have a vital function in the human body. They  filter the wastage of your body which further excretes from your urine. This chronic disease places severe burden on your body. Especially when it reaches an advanced level. It builds hazardous fluid, wastage and electrolytes in your body. Nephrons which performs the filtration work often get damaged in kidney disease. Hence it makes them lose their working strength. There are some severe negative outcomes of chronic kidney disease.which include:
<br>
<div class="margin-top-10">
<ul class="text-right disease col-md-4"><li>Cancer</li></ul>
<ul class="text-center disease col-md-4"><li>Infections</li></ul>
<ul class="text-left disease col-md-4"><li>Stones</li></ul><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

<div>
Like any other disease, kidney disease also has few symptoms, but you will observe these symptoms only when the kidney function loses its strength and starts getting revealed . The cure for this disease emphasizes  restricting the kidney damage by reaching to the root cause. Kidney disease can lead towards kidney failure, which is absolutely dangerous and the only way to avoid this risk is either dialysis or a kidney transplant.

<div class="arthritis margin-top-30">
<h5 class="small-heading">Arthritis</h5>
Arthritis causes pain and creates problems in moving around. The pain that you feel while moving and stiffness in your body are the major consequences of arthritis. Arthritis is basically a pain in the joints. Joints basically mean, where two bones meet and when these joints get swollen then it results in pain. These joints must get proper treatment on time otherwise there are chances of getting severely damaged. There are some types of arthritis, which later causes a negative impact on your organs as well.
<ul class="text-left disease">
<li>Osteoarthritis relate to the older age people or to those who have an injury.</li>
<li>The second of arthritis is Autoimmune arthritis, which has a straight link with your immune system, it happens when your immune system impacts your cells in the body mistakenly. There is another common form of this disease named as Rheumatoid arthritis. Not only elders, but children also have a similar kind of disease which is known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. </li>
<li>Another type of arthritis is Infectious arthritis, which means an extended infection from a different part of the body to the joints. </li>
<li>People who suffer from psoriasis disease which means having red patches on the skin are affected by the Psoriatic arthritis.</li>
<li>When uric acid increases to a greater extent, then it leads to Gout, which initially begins in the big toe. </li>
