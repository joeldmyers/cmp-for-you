<h5 class="small-heading margin-top-30">Heart disease</h5>Most of the people think that heart disease is probably not our problem, it often happens to other, but in reality the large number of deaths occurs due to the heart diseases in US. In case if its get severe then the patient will either end up by losing his/her life or at least disability. 
Heart disease has many different kinds among which the most common reason of heart disease is either the blockage of coronary arteries or sometimes these arteries becomes narrow, which eventually affect the blood vessels that circulates the blood to the heart. 
This particular disease is called coronary artery disease, it happens gradually over different time intervals and it’s possibly the biggest reason that causes heart attacks.
  
  <img src="<?=$remotelocation;?>includes/images/6.png" class="img-responsive margin-top-30"><br>
  <div>
The "heart disease" and "cardiovascular disease" are the two terms that we use to denote the same problem. Narrowed arteries, blocked vessels, angina or stroke come under the cardiovascular disease. The same way other conditions, which affect heart's muscle and circulation are linked to the kinds of heart disease. There are multiple conditions that place an impact on our heart in different ways. Blood vessel diseases, coronary disease, heart flow problems, also known as (arrhythmia) and congenital heart defects (A heart defect you are born with). 
It's not yet done, there are few more problems that either occurs to the valves in the heart or sometimes the heart does not pump well, which causes heart failure. There are certain measures that you can follow to successfully eliminate the heart disease risk.

<div class="cancer margin-top-30 margin-bottom-30">
<h5 class="small-heading">Cancer</h5>
Cancer is considered one of the major lives taking disease, it develops uncommon cells that spread uncontrollably in the body, these cells are capable to penetrate and demolish body tissue. Cancer has the ability to cover the entire body in no time. In United States cancer is known as the second leading cause of death. But now it is being observed that improvements in cancer treatment and proper screening are leading patients to successfully overcoming this disease.<br>
Cancer initially flows in our cells, directly hitting the most important part of the body creates quick trouble, usually our body makes new cells, according to our need as a substitute of the dead cells. This function of replacing old cells with the new one often goes wrong, sometimes new cells grow even when our body does not really need them and the old cells do not really die when they are supposed to be dead. This process of creating surplus cells causes a tumor. <br>Tumor sometimes could be dangerous or sometimes not, the benign (not dangerous for human body) tumor cannot be considered a as cancer, whereas malignant (dangerous for human body) is a part of it. Malignant tumor creates cells, which can destroy the tissues and they have the tendency to spread into the other parts of the body. The tendency of shifting into the other parts of the body is called metastasis. Cancer is not a name of a single disease, but it consist more than 100 different types and these types are named after the body part they belong. For an instance, if cancer is in lungs, then it would be named lung cancer; the same thing applies to breast cancer and so on. The causes and treatment varies according to the stage of cancer, treatment methods are followed according to advance level of cancer, sometimes surgery is recommended or sometimes it become feasible to destroy the tumor with radiation or chemotherapy.

<div class="stroke margin-top-30 margin-bottom-30">
<h5 class="small-heading">Stroke</h5>
Stroke is yet another major illness, when the circulation of blood stop reaching to the brain then it causes stroke. It often happens that within no time brain cells start to die. Ischemic, hemorrhagic and transient ischemic are the three kinds of stroke. Ischemic stroke happens with a blood clot that stops the blood vessel in brain, hemorrhagic stroke caused by the breakage blood vessels which leads the blood flows into the brain and transient ischemic attack occurs when the blood supply gets interrupted, this attack is also known as mini strokes.
<img src="<?=$remotelocation;?>includes/images/5.png" class="img-responsive">

<ul class="text-left disease">
There are few symptoms of stroke :
<li>Any side of the body suddenly starts getting weak. (It could be leg, arm or face)</li>
<li>Sudden trouble speaking or understanding speech.</li>
<li>Blurry vision</li>
<li>Difficulty in walking and balancing</li>
<li>Severe headache with no particular reason.</li>
</ul>

<div>If you encounter any of these symptoms happening to you then rushing to the hospital on an early basis would be the best option. <br>
There are certain stroke therapies that quickly dissolve the blood clot and by putting an end to the bleeding. Post stroke care helps the stroke victims in overcoming their disabilities. Drug therapy is yet another way through which the blood gets thinner and it’s the most common cure for stroke. The major causes of stroke are, either blood supply is interrupted or lack of oxygen and nutrients to the brain. The positive thing about the disease is, it has a proper cure and its been more than a decade now that only few Americans have died of this disease.

<div class="diabetes margin-top-30 margin-bottom-30">
<h5 class="small-heading">Diabetes</h5>
Diabetes is a long-term illness regarding high blood sugar level in the body, which we also term as (Glucose). Glucose is the important source of energy for the body cells; it works as a fuel to the cells so that these cells build muscles, tissues and also known as the driving force to the brain. Having diabetes means you have an excess Glucose in your blood, regardless what type of diabetes you have, glucose carries equal affect to the body, excess amount of glucose is dangerous for health. 
<img src="<?=$remotelocation;?>includes/images/7.png" class="img-responsive margin-bottom-30 margin-top-30">
Having high sugar level or glucose means you have diabetes; we get the glucose in our body from the food we eat. The hormone which gives energy to the cells is called Insulin. <br>
There are few types of diabetes. The 1st type of diabetes means your body has a lack of Insulin, <br>the 1st type of diabetes is also a part of chronic diabetes, 2nd  type means lack of proper usage of the insulin, it's also known as the most common type of diabetes. Our body needs enough insulin to make the energy reach to the cells, if this does not really happen, the excess amount of the glucose will remain still. The 3rd type is pre-diabetes, which means the sugar level in our body stays higher than a normal level, but still we cannot consider pre-diabetes as a proper type of diabetes but ignoring it would eventually result in having the 2nd type of diabetes.
<br> An excess amount of glucose can cause serious health issues; it can place a negative impact either on your eyes, kidneys or nerves. If a person has diabetes, then the probability of getting linked to stroke and heart diseases become higher, sometimes it even makes you lose your limb. Sometimes pregnant women also become diabetic and that is called gestational diabetes, it gets resolved after the delivery. The appropriate ways can make you control your diabetes, such as doing exercise, weight control and follow a proper diet plan. Monitoring the glucose level and taking prescribed medicines would be beneficial as well. 

<h5 class="small-heading margin-top-20">PreDiabetes</h5>
Pre-diabetes does not really mean that you have diabetes, one can simply not term pre-diabetes as type 2 diabetes unless and until the sugar level exceed the normal level with a greater extent, if the amount of sugar level in your body stays higher than the normal level but still does not exceed the extraordinary level then it cannot be considered as type 2 diabetes. Pre-diabetes almost take a decade to become type 2 diabetes only if no intervention occurs in between.<br> 
Pre-diabetes places negative affect on the heart and circulatory system, once you become a pre-diabetic then it means, the damage to your heart and circulatory system have already started. Diagnosing pre-diabetes could be a challenge as it does not have any particular symptoms, but scheduling a visit to your doctor for blood test would be helpful because the blood test will help you in taking an idea of the glucose level that you have in your blood.<br><br> Doctors recommend pre-diabetes test to those who are carrying overweight and have crossed the age of 45. One good thing about pre-diabetes is it could be a plus point for you to concentrate on your health and improving it. Controlling pre-diabetes is possible and this is how you can restrict it from reaching the type 2 diabetes.
As it has already been discussed, maintaining weight, making a proper diet plan, engaging your body in physical activity in your daily routine would be a worth taking steps, as it will result in getting your sugar level back to normal state. 
The other way of controlling pre-diabetes is, losing weight through calories. Losing 10-20 pounds can surely make a big difference, one more thing that you can do is keeping yourself physically active will result in making the insulin work better. Furthermore, doctors also suggest taking medicines to control glucose level.

<div class="copd margin-top-30 margin-bottom-30">
<h5 class="small-heading">COPD</h5>
COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This disease creates difficulty in breathing through the blockage in the lungs, which results breathing problem. There are two types of COPD i.e. bronchitis and emphysema. Chronic bronchitis is the swelling on the lining of bronchial tube, bronchial tube helps in breathing, inhaling and exhaling the air from the lungs is the process which gets completed through bronchial tube. On the other hand emphysema happens when the air gets blocked at the pass through passages in the lungs and the tube gradually starts getting destroyed. COPD has no cure, but you can take a sigh of relief by reversing symptoms back to normal. 
Inhaling Dust, Cigarette smoke, pollution and chemical vapor can cause COPD. Initially COPD has no symptoms to be diagnosed; the symptoms can be diagnosed when they get worse.
They include :

<ul class="text-right col-md-6 disease margin-top-10">
<li>Cough with mucus</li>
<li>Difficulty in breathing while doing physical activity</li>
</ul>
<ul class="text-left col-md-6 disease margin-top-10">
<li>Whistle sound during breathing</li>
<li>Tightness of Chest</li></ul><div class="clearfix"></div><br>

There are certain tests which help in diagnosing COPD, these tests are also prescribed by the doctors, some of them are, lung function test, imaging tests and blood tests. 
Unfortunately, there is no cure for this disease; the only remedy for this disease is to get relieve from the symptoms. 
Before stepping forward for treatment the best thing you can do is quit smoking as it would be your first step towards treating COPD. 
Further, there are very few options available for treating this disease positively, like taking prescribed medicines, oxygen therapy or lung transplant.

<div class="chronic-kidney margin-top-30 margin-bottom-30">
<h5 class="small-heading">Chronic Kidney Disease</h5>
Before getting into the deepness of this disease, we first need to know the important role that our kidneys play in our body; our kidneys are bean shaped with a size of no more or less than our fists. They are placed in the lower middle back. Each kidney has a function of removing waste and extra water; these functions are being performed by the small nephrons present in the kidney to filter the circulating blood. The fluid later excretes from urine. The bladder stores the urine till it excretes. 
<br>Kidney failure is yet another major disease which is also known as chronic kidney disease; 
kidneys have a vital function in the human body, the kidneys filter the wastage of your body which further excretes from your urine. Chronic disease places severe impact on your body, especially when it reaches to the advance level, it builds hazardous fluid, wastage and electrolytes in your body.  Nephrons which performs the filtration work often get damaged in kidney disease, hence it make them lose their working strength. There are some severe negative outcomes of chronic kidney disease, which includes.
<br>
<div class="margin-top-10">
<ul class="text-right disease col-md-4"><li>Cancer</li></ul>
<ul class="text-center disease col-md-4"><li>Infections</li></ul>
<ul class="text-left disease col-md-4"><li>Stones</li></ul><div class="clearfix"></div></div>

<div>
Like any other disease, kidney disease also has few symptoms, but you will observe these symptoms only when the kidney function loses its strength and starts getting revealed to the mind.
The cure for this disease emphasize on restricting the kidney damage by reaching to the root cause. 
Kidney disease can lead towards kidney failure, which is absolutely dangerous and the only way to avoid this risk is either dialysis or a kidney transplant.
